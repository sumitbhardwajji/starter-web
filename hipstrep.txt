A crash test dummy, or simply dummy, is a full-scale anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body during a traffic collision. Dummies are used by researchers, automobile and aircraft manufacturers to predict the injuries a person might sustain in a crash.
The dummy text file. Often it is convenient to use LSMW to run snippets of code or to generate reports that don't relate to anything in a source file. LSMW still requires that a source file be specified and read into the system when running the program (converting data) even when the only code is in the Begin of Processing area and no data is actually being converted.
In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about. Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged
